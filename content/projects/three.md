I submitted a PR to add filtering functionality to this command line tool to generate directory trees, written in Rust. This makes the tool significantly more useful, as it is often helpful to generate a directory tree visualization, but without the ability to filter out generated files and directories (build, dist, etc.) the visualization can lose its utility.
