# Personal Landing Page

This is the repository for a personal portfolio site, built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator (SSG) written in Rust ðŸ¦€


## Theme
The site uses the [HayFlow theme](https://www.getzola.org/themes/hayflow/), a clean, modular theme built for Zola designed for landing pages.
